{% excerpt %}
I was following along [David Nolen's Om tutorial](https://github.com/swannodette/om/wiki/Tutorial) and found a curious error. When I got to [the part](https://github.com/swannodette/om/wiki/Tutorial#wiki-debugging-om-components) where the delete buttons weren't supposed to work, they worked just fine. Adding the derefing to contacts resulted in:

{% syntax console %}
Uncaught Error: No protocol method IDeref.-deref defined for type om.core/MapCursor: [object Object]
{% endsyntax %}

{% endexcerpt %}

I thought it might have to do with my Om version. Sure enough, latest was 0.3.0 and I was in 0.2.3. I went to `project.cljs` and changed my dependencies to:

{% syntax clojure %}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.1"]
                 [org.clojure/clojurescript "0.0-2138"]
                 [org.clojure/core.async "0.1.267.0-0d7780-alpha"]
                 [om "0.3.0"] ; was [om "0.2.3"]
                 [com.facebook/react "0.8.0.1"]]
{% endsyntax %}

But it didn't work as expected. I asked David on twitter and he kindly pointed me to [this Github issue](https://github.com/swannodette/om/issues/75), where I found the missing step:

{% syntax bash %}
$ lein cljsbuild clean
{% endsyntax %}

To regenerate the compiled js. With that done, everything worked as expected.
