{% excerpt %}
If you are getting a `Unable to resolve module` error when trying to `import` or `require` a local JSX file in a React Native project:
{% endexcerpt %}

{% syntax javascript %}
import App from './components/App.jsx';
{% endsyntax %}

And the red screen suggestion doesn't work:

<div class='figure'>
    <a href='http://cfsl.net/tsunami/?p=829'><img class='article-image centered' alt="Unable to resolve module..." src='{{site.url}}/media/images/posts/unable-to-resolve-module.png' /></a>
    <p class='caption'>Unable to resolve module...</p>
</div>

The actual problem is that [React Native doesn't support the JSX extension](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/0893d07db197b4f78752f982abbc568c6c0c7419). Rename your file to `App.js` and it'll work just fine.
